# Phase-1-Project

# Aviation Safety Analysis  

## Overview  
As our company expands into aviation, this project analyzes historical accident data to identify **low-risk aircraft** for commercial and private operations. By understanding accident trends and risk factors, we can make data-driven decisions when selecting aircraft for our fleet.  

## Business Problem  
Aircraft accidents pose significant financial and operational risks. The goal of this analysis is to:  
- Identify aircraft models with the lowest accident rates.  
- Analyze key accident causes and patterns.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for safer aircraft choices.
